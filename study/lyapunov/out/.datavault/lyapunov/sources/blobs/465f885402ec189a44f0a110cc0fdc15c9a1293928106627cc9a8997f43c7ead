# test_report_demo.jl — a DEMONSTRATION: what `Pinax.test()` renders out of an ordinary suite. Pinax
# does not yet publish a report of its own suite (#120). It is plain `@testset`/`@test` — no token —
# but written so the rendered report exercises the pieces the bridge adds: a swept `@testset for` folded
# into a convergence figure + a tolerance-margin figure, and `@caption` naming the quantity. The
# assertions are genuine (a real convergent quadrature), so under a bare `Pkg.test()` this is an honest
# smoke test of the environment's floating point; under `Pinax.test()` it draws itself.
# NOTE: the wrapper testset is DESCRIPTIVE, not the file name — `runtests.jl` already wraps every file
# in `@testset "<file>.jl"`, and a second `.jl`-named testset would nest a page inside a page.
@testset "midpoint rule → π (a convergence study)" begin
    @desc md"The midpoint rule for the integral of 4/(1+x^2) on [0,1] converges to π as O(1/n²). The report shows the estimate approaching π and the tolerance budget shrinking — from the numbers the suite already computed, with no figure code."

    # `@code` shows the computation behind the figure (Documenter `@example`-like): the source is
    # rendered as a snippet, and it still runs — the definition leaks out, so the sweep below uses it.
    @code caption = "the quadrature" midpoint(n) =
        sum(k -> 4 / (1 + ((k - 0.5) / n)^2), 1:n) / n

    # An unnamed `@testset for` is a SAMPLE, not a section: these four iterations fold into ONE
    # convergence figure (got vs n, π as the reference, the tolerance as a band) plus a margin figure.
    # `@caption` names the quantity, so the figure is titled `midpoint rule → π`, not the raw expression.
