# Run — the facade that ties work_fn to Vault, Lock, Manifest, Log

# Evolution across todos:
#   09: minimal (sequential, no manifest, no lock)
#   10: + Manifest (early skip)
#   11: + KeyLock (multi-master)
#   12: + retry
#   13: + automatic `pmap(WorkerPool(workers()), ...)` dispatch when
#       `nprocs() > 1`, so a single master can fan out over local
#       `addprocs(n)` or a SLURM cluster allocated via
#       `SlurmClusterManager`.  No per-file change needed in user
#       compute scripts — they still call `run!(work_fn, vault, keys)`.

             heartbeat_interval=60.0, stop_flag=nothing, deadline=nothing)

Execution options for [`run!`](@ref).

# Fields

- `workers::Symbol = :auto` — dispatch mode. `:auto` fans out over the
  Distributed `WorkerPool(workers())` via `pmap` when `nprocs() > 1`, and runs
  sequentially otherwise. `:sequential` forces the sequential path even when
  worker processes are present (useful for debugging a serialization issue).
- `max_attempts::Int = 3` — per-key retry budget. Set to `1` to disable
  retry (a failed `work_fn` is logged as `:error` instead of `:gave_up`).
- `stale_after::Float64 = 600.0` — seconds before another master can reclaim a
  held lock as stale. Passed through to `DataVault.acquire_running!`.
- `heartbeat_interval::Float64 = 60.0` — how often the per-lock heartbeat task
  refreshes DataVault's `.running` file. Enforced to be `<` `stale_after`
  (otherwise a live holder's lock could be reclaimed mid-work).
- `log_level::Symbol = :info` — event-log verbosity. At `:info` (default) the
  high-churn per-key `:lock_busy` and `:key_start` events are suppressed (their
  totals still ride in the `:stage_done` summary), keeping the JSONL log
  O(computed keys) instead of O(masters × keys) under multi-master contention.
  Set `:debug` to log them (e.g. to debug lock contention).
- `stop_flag::Union{String,Nothing}` — path to a sentinel file. When
  `isfile(stop_flag)` becomes true, [`run!`](@ref) and [`run_loop!`](@ref)
  stop dispatching new keys and return early. This is the infra equivalent
  of FiniteTemperature.jl's `STOP_NOW_\$JOB_ID` mechanism, typically created
  by a SIGUSR1 signal handler in the batch script 60 s before Slurm kills
  the job.

  **Defaults to `ENV["SWEEPRUNNER_STOP_FLAG"]`**, because the batch script
  that traps the signal and the driver that passes the option are different
  files, and the only thing they can agree on without one importing the
  other is the environment. Leaving the name to the caller meant every
  driver had to remember a variable this package never mentions; a driver
  that misspells it gets no error and no graceful stop, only a killed job.
  Pass `stop_flag=nothing` explicitly to opt out.

  **Granularity: the flag is read between keys, not inside one.** A key already
  in `work_fn` runs to completion, so the time between raising the flag and
  `run!` returning is bounded by the longest key, which the caller usually
  cannot predict.
- `deadline::Union{Float64,Nothing} = nothing` — an absolute `time()` past which
  no new key is handed out. The same mechanism as `stop_flag` with the same
  in-key granularity, and the reason to have both is that a deadline is set in
  ADVANCE: a batch job can subtract its longest expected key and the time its
  summary needs from the end of its allocation, where a flag raised reactively
  60 s before the wall clock cannot buy back a key that runs for ten minutes.

  ```julia
  RunOpts(deadline = time() + 25 * 60)   # stop dispatching 5 min before a 30 min job ends
  ```

- `defer_poll::Float64 = 30.0` — seconds [`run!`](@ref) waits before re-dispatching keys whose
  `work_fn` threw `DataVault.ArtifactBusy` (an artifact being built by another worker or job),
  when the previous pass made no progress. A deferred key costs no attempt.

# Example

opts = RunOpts(max_attempts=5, stale_after=900.0, heartbeat_interval=30.0,

"""
    run!(work_fn, vault, keys; opts=RunOpts(), load=nothing, observe=true) -> NamedTuple

Run `work_fn(key) -> Dict` for every `key` in `keys`, persisting through
`vault`. Writes a structured JSONL event log at
`joinpath(vault.outdir, "events_<hostname>_<pid>.jsonl")` — one file per master,
so concurrent masters never contend on a single log.

`load` names the module(s) the **worker** processes need beyond the always-loaded seam
(`ParamIO`/`DataVault`/`SweepRunner`) — typically the package or module that defines `work_fn`
and the types it touches. Accepts a `Module`, `Symbol`, `String`, or a collection of them (e.g.
`load=MyModel` or `load=[MyModel, Statistics]`). Under `:distributed`/`:slurm`, `run!` `using`s
these in `Main` on every worker before fan-out, so a compute script no longer has to hand-roll the
`for w in workers(); remotecall_fetch(…, :(using …)); end` broadcast. It is a no-op on the master
(`nprocs() == 1`) and idempotent, so it is safe even when a project still broadcasts by hand.

Early skip (todo 10): on startup a stage-level Manifest is loaded. Keys
already in the manifest are skipped — when all keys are done, the second
run-through takes O(1) filesystem operations regardless of `length(keys)`.

# Source observations

With `observe=true` (the default) the master and every worker call `DataVault.observe_sources`
before any key is dispatched, and each `.done` a process writes carries that process's token
(`observation=<token>`). The observation records what the source looked like at `run!` start and
its **binding** — how far the code that process had loaded was checked against it — so a marker
never claims more than was checked. `work_fn` is named as the entry code: the binding can be
`loaded-matches-disk` only when it is a function of a package loaded from the study's sources, not
a closure or a function defined in the driving script (those are `unverified`, with the reason). An observation that fails does not stop the run: the event log
says why, and that process's markers read `observation=unknown`, as they do with `observe=false`.

# Affinity

`affinity` is `key -> value`, and turns the fan-out from "any free worker takes the next key" into
"a free worker PREFERS a key whose `affinity` value it has already handled". Pass it when `work_fn`
memoises something per group in worker-local state, so a worker that stays on a group pays the load
once instead of once per key.

    run!(work_fn, vault, keys; affinity = k -> param(k, "system.L"))

A preference, not a partition: a worker is never idle while a key is pending, so a 200-key group
does not serialise onto the worker that opened it. When a worker has nothing from its own groups
left it takes from the group with the most work outstanding, which spreads workers over groups.

Only affects the `pmap` path; the sequential path already visits keys in order.

Returns `(; stage, done, err, busy, gave_up, stop, skipped, total, stopped_by)`. `stopped_by` is
`:flag`, `:deadline`, or `nothing`: a stage that finished every key reports `nothing` even if the
deadline passed while its last key ran, since no key was ever held back by it.
The full-done early exit returns the same field set rather than a shorter one.

Contract:
- `work_fn` is expected to be a pure function: given a `DataKey`, return a
  `Dict` payload to persist via `DataVault.save!`.
- Exceptions in `work_fn` are caught and logged; the corresponding key's
  `.done` file is not written, so re-runs will pick it up.
- The stage label used for logging is `Symbol(vault.run)`.
- Manifest is monotonic: saved at end-of-stage with every newly completed key.

# Parallel dispatch

If `nprocs() > 1` (i.e. `init_workers!(mode=:distributed|:slurm)` has added
worker processes), `run!` automatically fans out over the Distributed
`WorkerPool(workers())` via `pmap`.  Each worker runs the per-key
lock-acquire → `work_fn` → `DataVault.save!` → `mark_done!` pipeline
independently.  All filesystem operations (the `.running` lock, atomic JLD2 write,
JSONL event log) are already NFS-safe, so concurrent workers inside one
master are structurally consistent with multi-master operation.

If only the master is active (`nprocs() == 1`), `run!` falls back to the
sequential loop from todo 11.  This means the same compute.jl script is
valid in three modes:

1. No `init_workers!` call at all → sequential on the master.
2. `init_workers!(mode=:distributed)` with `addprocs(n)` → local pmap fan-out.
3. `init_workers!(mode=:slurm)` inside a SLURM job → cluster fan-out.

Multi-master locking (several separate julia processes writing to the
same vault) continues to work underneath either path because the lock
layer (DataVault's `.running`) uses POSIX `link()` / atomic `rename` only.

    run_loop!(work_fn, vault, keys; opts=RunOpts(), max_empty_rounds=3,
              idle_sleep=30.0, load=nothing, prerequisite=nothing) -> NamedTuple

Work-stealing loop that repeatedly calls [`run!`](@ref) until there is no
more work to do. This is the infra equivalent of FiniteTemperature.jl's
`_work_loop` driver.

The loop exits when:
- `max_empty_rounds` consecutive rounds produce zero new completions AND leave nothing held by a
  sibling, or
- `opts.stop_flag` is raised, or `opts.deadline` has passed.

A round that completes nothing but finds keys `:lock_busy` does NOT count toward
`max_empty_rounds` until `opts.stale_after` has been waited out. Those keys are either being
worked on by a live sibling, or held by one the wall clock killed, and `stale_after` is what
separates the two: past it, `acquire_running!` reclaims the lock on the next attempt. Returning
before then leaves the campaign short and reports nothing, because `max_empty_rounds *
idle_sleep` (90 s by default) is an order of magnitude under `stale_after` (600 s).

Default parameters (`max_empty_rounds=3`, `idle_sleep=30.0`) are the
battle-tested values from FiniteTemperature.jl.

`load` is forwarded verbatim to every [`run!`](@ref) call (see its docstring) — name the work
module(s) the workers need and the loop handles the per-round broadcast.

# Prerequisite

`run!` locks the KEY, so no two workers compute the same key. Work shared BETWEEN keys has to live
inside `work_fn`, and there it has no protection at all: every worker that wants a setup not yet on
disk builds it itself.

Pass a [`Prerequisite`](@ref) and that setup becomes its own key space, run to completion by
[`run_prerequisite!`](@ref) before the dependent stage starts. It then gets the same locking,
resume and provenance as any other stage, and its cost is recorded in its own payload instead of
landing on whichever dependent key happened to run first.

    run_loop!(work_fn, vault, keys;
              prerequisite = Prerequisite(prep_fn, prep_vault, derived_keys),
              opts = opts)

If the prerequisite does not complete, the dependent stage does NOT start, and the returned
`prerequisite` field says why. Running it anyway would spend the allocation on keys whose setup is
known to be missing.

**SweepRunner does not know which dependent key needs which prerequisite key.** The dependency is
one level deep and resolved inside `work_fn`, so this is "all of the prerequisite, then all of the
dependents", not a DAG.

`affinity` is forwarded verbatim to every [`run!`](@ref) call.

Returns `(; ran, rounds, done, busy, stopped_by, prerequisite)`. `busy` is how many keys the last
round found held by a sibling, so a caller can tell "everything is done" from "someone else still
has work out". `ran` is `false` exactly when a prerequisite blocked the stage.
