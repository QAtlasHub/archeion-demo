# Compose with TestShards: a SHARDED suite renders as one document, with margins.
#
# TestShards splits a test suite across CI jobs, and it runs each shardable unit inside a testset it
# builds by hand rather than through `@testset` — deliberately, so that a failed unit can still be
# read back (a top-level `@testset` throws before returning its tree). Two consequences for us, and
# both are silent:
#
#   TYPE     `Test` builds a nested testset from its PARENT's type, which is the only reason our
#            capture sees a suite at all. A unit's testset is not ours, so inside a unit
#            `_current_container()` is `:inert`: no checks, and a test-side `@figure` / `@code`
#            no-ops. Measured: a `@shard` suite under `Pinax.test` renders `0/0 passed` — empty AND
#            green, indistinguishable from a suite with no tests.
#   NESTING  the unit's testset is popped by hand and never `finish`ed, and we attach a child to its
#            parent IN `finish`. Measured: after the pop the root has 0 children; after
#            `Test.finish` it has 1.
#
# TestShards answers both with a registered provider (`register_unit_provider!`), and the provider
# belongs HERE: it needs the counts out of `PinaxTestSet`, which is ours and private, while its side
# of the seam is one function call and no types of theirs. The reverse placement would have TestShards
# reading six private fields of a type it does not own.

The testset for one shardable unit, or `nothing` to decline it and leave TestShards' default.

Declined unless a capture is **ambient** — that is, the caller installed a capturing root
(`Pinax.test`), which is exactly when a document is being built. Never keyed on an environment
variable: a suite that merely depends on Pinax must not have its testset type changed underneath it,
and a bare `Pkg.test()` must run exactly as it did before (invariant V — the report changes nothing
about how the suite runs).

"""
Turn what a test **established** into content on the node that established it.

`evidence!(; tolerance = 1e-12, achieved = err, oracle = "closed-form")` is a test saying what grounds
it — and a report that shows the verdict and the margin still leaves that unsaid. It is data, so it
becomes a `@table`: legible to a reader, and *native rows* in `agent.json`, where it is the binding an
agent needs to reconcile a claim against what was actually compared.

Attached per node, walking the children, because that is where the test recorded it — a nested
`@testset` keeps its own. Keys are sorted, so a rebuild produces the same table rather than a
different order of the same facts (the render cache keys on content).

The id is qualified by the UNIT, matching how the fold qualifies section ids (`<page>_<section>`):
a node's own id is a bare slug at this point, so two files each with a `@testset "tight"` that records
evidence would otherwise land two tables on one anchor.

One case does not survive, and it is not silent: evidence recorded inside a swept `@testset for` is
dropped with the rest of that sample's content, and Pinax already warns that a `@table` inside a
sweep is not folded.

the testset is ours: the same numbers by a different route, which is the first thing its tests check.

Pinax converts each result into a `Check` as it is recorded rather than keeping `Test`'s own
`results`, so the counts come from that: an ERROR is both `nerror` and a non-passing check, and a
BROKEN test is counted without becoming a check at all (it did not pass, but the runner is content,
