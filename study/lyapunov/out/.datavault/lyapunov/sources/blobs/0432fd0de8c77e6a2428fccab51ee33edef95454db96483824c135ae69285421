# EventLog — structured JSONL event logging.
#
# Per-item `println` logging is a non-goal and is not part of the public API.
# FiniteTemperature.jl used to emit ~300 MB of job logs by printing a line
# for every one of 3600 keys; switching to aggregated events collapses that
# to ~1 event per key plus a handful of per-stage events.

    EventLog(path::AbstractString)

Append-only JSONL event log with a thread-safe per-`EventLog` lock.

Each call to [`log_event`](@ref) writes one JSON object as a single line.
Concurrent writes from multiple tasks are serialized through a
`ReentrantLock` held per PATH, so several `EventLog` objects on one file
share it. Concurrent writes from multiple _processes_ (separate masters)
rely on POSIX `O_APPEND` atomicity, which is guaranteed for single `write`
syscalls of length `< PIPE_BUF` (4 KiB); `log_event` composes each line as
a single `String` and issues one `write` to an unbuffered descriptor to
stay within that guarantee.

# Fields

- `path::String` — target JSONL file. Parent directory is created lazily on
  first [`log_event`](@ref).
- `lock::ReentrantLock` — the per-path lock at construction time. [`log_event`](@ref) resolves the
  lock from `path` rather than reading this field, so an `EventLog` that arrived on a worker by
  deserialization (which skips the constructor) still serialises against its siblings there.

# Event kinds used by `run!`

[`run!`](@ref) emits the following `kind` values (as strings in the JSON):

| kind            | when                                                              |
| :-------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `stage_start`   | once at the top of `run!` when `todo` is non-empty                |
| `stage_done`    | once at the bottom of `run!` when `todo` was non-empty            |
| `key_acquired`  | the per-key lock was taken (includes `acq`); the only durable       |
|                 | record of a claim, since a SIGKILL skips every later event         |
| `key_start`     | before each `work_fn(key)` attempt (includes `attempt` field)     |
| `key_done`      | after a successful `work_fn(key)` (includes `secs`, `attempt`)    |
| `lock_busy`     | another master holds the `.running` lock (acquire = `:busy`)      |
| `lock_lost`     | our lock was reclaimed mid-work; result discarded (no double-run) |
| `lock_reaped`   | a lock whose holder was shown dead was cleared without waiting     |
| `reap_failed`   | reaping threw; the key falls back to the `stale_after` timeout     |
| `lock_reclaimed`| (reserved, not currently emitted)                                 |
| `error`         | `work_fn` threw on this attempt                                   |
| `retry`         | another attempt will follow                                       |
| `gave_up`       | all `max_attempts` attempts exhausted                             |
| `skip_complete` | full-done early exit (manifest had every key)                     |
| `worker_died`   | the worker exited on this key every time it was dispatched, up to |
|                 | the re-dispatch bound (includes `deaths`)                          |
| `worker_lost`   | every worker died with keys still queued; this key was left for a  |
|                 | later run rather than completed or failed                          |
| `artifact_busy` | `work_fn` threw `DataVault.ArtifactBusy`; the key is deferred, no  |
|                 | attempt spent (includes `artifact`)                                |
| `deferred_round`| `run!` re-dispatches its deferred keys (includes `round`, `keys`) |

`:key_start` and `:lock_busy` are emitted at `:debug` level and are suppressed
unless the `EventLog` is created with `min_level=:debug` (see `RunOpts.log_level`);
their totals still appear in `:stage_done`. Downstream analysis (`jq`,
DataFrame-based) can filter and aggregate over these kinds without ever parsing
freeform text.

# Example

```julia
log = EventLog("out/events.jsonl")
log_event(log, :stage_start; stage=:phase1, todo=3600)
# ... work ...
log_event(log, :stage_done; stage=:phase1, done=3600, err=0)
```

"""
    log_event(log, kind; kwargs...)

Append one JSON object to `log.path` with fields `ts` (ISO-8601 local time),
`kind` (the `Symbol` converted to `String`), and any additional key/value
pairs passed via `kwargs`.

The line is built in full (including the trailing newline) as a single
`String` and written with one `write` syscall to an UNBUFFERED append-mode
descriptor. Both halves matter: the syscall is what POSIX `O_APPEND`
atomicity applies to, so cross-process writes do not tear each other's
lines, and an `IOStream` would flush on its own boundaries instead.

```julia
log_event(log, :key_done; stage=:phase1, key="N=8;J=1.0;#sample=1", secs=12.3)
```

produces one line like:

```json
{"ts":"2026-04-13T14:23:51.123","kind":"key_done","stage":"phase1","key":"N=8;J=1.0;#sample=1","secs":12.3}
```

Returns `nothing`.
