# The TestShards provider, end to end. Without it the two packages are mutually blind and silently
# so: a `@shard` suite under `Pinax.test` renders `0/0 passed` — empty AND green, indistinguishable
# from a suite with no tests. Every assertion below is the difference between composing and not.
#
# It IS part of the default suite now. It used to sit in `test/ext/` with a CI job of its own,
# because TestShards was not in General and so could not be an `[extras]` dependency —
# `Pkg.test` demands a registered package. TestShards was registered on 2026-08-03, TestShards
# is in `[extras]` and the test target, and this file is a `test/test_*.jl` the glob picks up
# like any other. The dedicated job is gone with it.

# A fixture whose numbers are the point: a check that passes with almost no room left, and a
# `@testset for` sweep, which Pinax folds into a convergence figure rather than three sections.
