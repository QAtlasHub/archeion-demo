LogisticMap — a dependency-free toy "physics" kernel for the examples.

The logistic map  x_{n+1} = r · x_n · (1 − x_n)  is the textbook route to
chaos. As the control parameter `r` grows it goes through period-doubling
into a chaotic regime near r ≈ 3.5699, with a fully chaotic band at r = 4.

We use it because it is:
- pure Julia, zero dependencies (so the example runs anywhere `julia` runs),
- a real "sweep one control parameter, extract one observable" workload —
  structurally identical to a DMRG / Monte-Carlo sweep, just 1000× faster.

`lyapunov(r, x0)` is the observable the example computes per parameter point.
It is **independent of the initial condition** `x0` (a property of the
attractor), which is why different `sample` values agree — a convenient way
to show reproducibility.

The work is a package function — `work_fn(key)` — precisely so the compute
driver can hand it to the workers with `run!(…; load=LogisticMap)` instead of
a hand-rolled `@everywhere include`/`remotecall` broadcast. Everything this
function reaches (the kernel below, plus its `using`s) travels with the
package, so there is no per-symbol broadcast to forget (the classic
`UndefVarError: now not defined` footgun).

`key.params` / `key.sample`.
