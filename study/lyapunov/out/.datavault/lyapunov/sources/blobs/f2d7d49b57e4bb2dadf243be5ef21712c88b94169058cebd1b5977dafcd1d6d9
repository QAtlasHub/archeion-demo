# Liveness — is the master that holds this lock still running?
#
# `stale_after` answers that by waiting. It has to, because a heartbeat can only ever say
# "recently alive"; the absence of one is indistinguishable from a slow filesystem until enough
# time has passed. Where the question CAN be asked outright, asking is worth several minutes of a
# batch allocation.
#
# Nothing here is required for correctness: every path degrades to `:unknown`, and `stale_after`
# then decides exactly as before. `:slurm` is one of four worker modes, so a mechanism that only
# worked there would cover a quarter of the runs.

    owner_token() -> String

The identity of ONE acquisition, stamped into `.running` by [`run!`](@ref) so a sibling can ask
about it later. `host:pid:nonce` from DataVault, with `:slurm<jobid>` appended inside a Slurm
allocation.

Call it per acquisition and do not cache it. The nonce is what tells a master's current hold from
a hold it lost and retook, and a token broadcast once per process cannot make that distinction.

The Slurm field is what makes the question answerable ACROSS hosts: `/proc` only works for a
holder on this machine, and the master of the job that was killed is usually somewhere else.

`:alive`, `:dead`, or `:unknown` for the holder named by an [`owner_token`](@ref).

`:dead` is only ever returned on positive evidence that the process is gone. Everything else is
`:unknown`, including every error path: a wrong `:dead` would hand a live master's key to someone
else, which is the one outcome the lock exists to prevent.

Two sources, in order:

1. a Slurm job id, when this process is ITSELF inside a Slurm allocation. The job is absent from
   the queue, so it has finished, been cancelled, or hit its wall clock.
2. the pid, when the holder is on THIS host and `/proc` exists. A recycled pid reads as `:alive`,
   which is the safe direction.
