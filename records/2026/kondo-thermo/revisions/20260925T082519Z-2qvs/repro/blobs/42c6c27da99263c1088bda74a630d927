# Adversarial tests for verify_workers! and init_workers! probing.
#
# These tests reproduce the ISSP production scenario that the original
# "happy path" tests missed: compute.jl loads SweepRunner on the
# master, addprocs() spawns workers that do NOT have SweepRunner
# loaded, then calls init_workers!(verbose=true) which invokes
# verify_workers!.
#
# Before the fix, verify_workers!'s @spawnat closure was serialized inside
# the SweepRunner module scope. Workers had no SweepRunner, so
# deserialization threw:
#
#     KeyError: key Base.PkgId(..., "SweepRunner") not found
#
# The fix is to build the probe via `remotecall(Core.eval, p, Main, quote ... end)`
# so the closure lives in the worker's Main module.
