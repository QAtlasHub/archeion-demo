# util/query.jl — programmatic read-oriented API for DataVault databases
#
# High-level primitives for discovering and attaching to previously written
# studies. Built on top of log.toml discovery (see util/log_toml.jl).
#
# Typical usage from an analysis / figure script:
#
#     for study in DataVault.open_all(outdir)
#         study.info.project_name == "linear_response" || continue
#         for key in DataVault.keys(study.vault; status=:done)
#             data = DataVault.load(study.vault, key)
#             # plot / analyze
#         end
#     end
#
# Attached vaults are normal writable `Vault`s: attaching effectively
# re-registers the current DataVault version with the existing log.toml.
# This lets you seamlessly resume computation — `mark_done!`, `save!`,
# `build_ledger`, etc. all work on attached vaults.

"""
    AttachedStudy

A bundle of (`vault`, log.toml `info`, `log_path`) produced by `open_all`.
Iterate over these to process every study under an outdir.

"""
    attach(log_path) -> Vault
    attach(outdir; project, run="default") -> Vault

Attach to a previously written (study, run) and return a `Vault`.

The first form takes the absolute path to a `log.toml` file directly.
The second form uses the frozen discovery contract — given an `outdir`,
a `project` name, and a `run` name, it resolves the log.toml at
`{outdir}/.datavault/{project}/{run}.log.toml` and attaches to it.
The two forms are distinguished by whether `project` is supplied.

Config resolution order:
  1. `{outdir}/{layout.config_snapshot}` — the frozen snapshot taken at
     initial construction; preferred because it is stable under moves and
     is colocated with the data.
  2. `log.toml[study].config` — the original absolute path recorded at
     construction; used as a fallback with a warning.
  3. Error if neither is available.

The returned `Vault` is fully writable. Its constructor will idempotently
upsert the log.toml, refreshing `[meta].datavault_version` and
`datavault_git_hash`. `created_at` is preserved.

`readonly=true` passes through to the constructor: the log.toml is validated but not rewritten, and
the returned vault refuses the write verbs. Use it for aggregates, progress counters and plotting
scripts, which otherwise leave a mark on every run they read.

as warnings and skipped so that iteration over a partially-corrupted
outdir still yields the healthy studies.

`readonly=true` attaches without writing. Discovery over an outdir touches every run it finds, so
a counter or a plotter run against three runs that had never executed a key creates three log.toml
files and freezes their key spaces.

comma-separated, no quoting, no embedded commas).

latest `.done` files.

[`build_master_ledger`](@ref)'s rows together with whether the sources were compatible:

- `columns`: the union of every contributing ledger's columns, sorted.
- `sources`: one `(; project_name, run, log_toml, nrows, columns, missing)` per contributing run,

- `collisions`: `(; project_name, run, column)` for each ledger column shadowed by one of the meta
  columns the merge adds.
- `ok`: every source has the full column set and nothing collided.

The schema that decides whether a merge is sound here is the CSV COLUMN SET, not `schema.toml`:
`build_ledger` derives its columns from the run's own params, so two runs whose key spaces differ
produce rows that are not the same shape. `check_schema_compat` answers a different question, which
is whether ONE run satisfies a reader's expectations.
