# Observe.jl — one source observation per process per run!, handed to every `.done` it writes.
#
# `DataVault.observe_sources` records what the source looked like and how far THIS process's loaded
# code was checked against it. A point's marker must carry the token of the process that computed
# it: under `pmap` that is the worker, whose loaded code need not be the master's. So each process
# observes for itself at `run!` start, keeps the token here, and `_run_one_with_retry!` — which runs
# on that same process — reads it back.
#
# Keyed by vault identity, not held in one slot, so two `run!`s sharing a process never hand each
# other's token to a marker.
