Read a config TOML and expand it into a list of `DataKey` — one per parameter
point in a sweep. Pure parsing and Cartesian enumeration: no IO, no storage, no
side effects.

ParamIO is **layer 1 of a three-package HPC stack**. It answers *what to
compute*; [`DataVault.jl`](https://github.com/QAtlasHub/DataVault.jl) answers
*where results go* (`DataKey` → storage), and
[`SweepRunner.jl`](https://github.com/QAtlasHub/SweepRunner.jl)
answers *do it* (`run!(work_fn, vault, keys)`, parallel and crash-recoverable).

```text
ParamIO            DataVault           SweepRunner
config.toml  ──►   Vault(config)  ──►  run!(work_fn, vault, keys)
   │  expand
   ▼
Vector{DataKey}
```

## Quick start

```julia
using ParamIO

spec = ParamIO.load("config.toml")     # TOML → ConfigSpec
keys = ParamIO.expand(spec)            # → Vector{DataKey}, one per (point × sample)

k = keys[1]
k.params              # Dict("system.N" => 8, "model.g" => 0.5, …)  — DOTTED keys
k.sample              # 1
ParamIO.format_path(k, spec.path_keys) # "sysN8_modg0.50"  — the on-disk dir name
ParamIO.canonical(k)  # "model.g=0.5;system.N=8;#sample=1"  — stable identity
```

Run [`examples/inspect.jl`](examples/inspect.jl) to print the full expansion of a
sample config — the fastest way to see what `expand` produces:

```bash
julia --project=. examples/inspect.jl
```

## Config schema

```toml
[study]
project_name  = "demo"          # study name (used by DataVault)
total_samples = 2               # repeats per parameter point
outdir        = "out"           # default output root

[datavault]
path_keys = ["system.N", "model.g"]   # DOTTED keys that name the on-disk dirs
# sweep_order = [...]                  # optional: override enumeration order

[[paramsets]]
[paramsets.system]
N = [8, 16]                     # list  ⇒ swept axis
T = { start = 1.0, stop = 4.0, length = 31 }   # grid ⇒ swept axis (31-pt linspace)
[paramsets.model]
g = [0.5, 1.0]                  # list  ⇒ swept axis
J = 1.0                         # scalar ⇒ fixed (still present in every DataKey)
```

`expand` takes the Cartesian product of all list-valued params across every
`[[paramsets]]` block, multiplies by `total_samples`, and deduplicates. Optional
`[base] inherit = "parent.toml"` merges a parent config first.

Deduplication is across blocks, so `length(expand(spec))` is **not** the product of the axis
lengths whenever two blocks overlap. The first block to produce a point also fixes its position,
which makes a small leading block a way to order a long acquisition: put the slice you want closed
first at the top, let it overlap a later broader block, and pay nothing for the repeat.
`expand_report(spec)` returns the per-block contribution, which is what tells a block that added
nothing from a block that was never read.

### Projections

A piece of a sweep's work often depends on only some of its axes. `project` is that sub-key space,
as an ordinary `ConfigSpec`, so the rest of the stack applies to it unchanged:

```julia
states = ParamIO.project(spec, ["system.L", "model.lambda", "thermal.beta"]; total_samples=1)
length(ParamIO.expand(states))   # how many distinct states this config needs
```

Every other parameter is dropped. `DataKey.sample` is not a parameter, so `total_samples` rather
than `axes` decides whether the projection keeps the sample dimension.

### Artifacts — intermediate results shared across cells

When the expensive part of a cell depends on only some of its axes — a ground state that does
not depend on the drive frequency — declare it, and name every parameter it reads:

```toml
[[paramsets]]
[paramsets.run]
U      = [0.0, 0.2]
D      = [64, 128]
omega1 = [1.2, 1.5, 1.8]
cutoff = 1.0e-14                     # fixed knobs are ordinary scalars, so they are in the key

[artifacts.ground_state]
depends_on = ["U", "D", "cutoff"]    # resolved like path_keys: dotted, or a unique leaf
version    = 1                       # bump when the code that builds it changes
# per_sample = true                  # if it also depends on the sample index
```

```julia
artifact_identity(spec, :ground_state, key)  # "ground_state@v1|run.D=64;run.U=0.0;run.cutoff=1.0e-14;#sample=1"
artifact_keys(spec, :ground_state)           # the 4 distinct points the 12 cells need
```

ParamIO only says what an artifact **is**; storing, locking and reusing it is DataVault's job.
The identity is exactly `depends_on` plus `version`, so **a parameter the builder reads but
`depends_on` omits does not invalidate it** — the artifact is then reused across that
parameter's values. `load` refuses an unknown field, an empty `depends_on` and a name some
`[[paramsets]]` block lacks, because each of those silently widens what is shared.

### Grid axes — concise sweeps

For a fine Monte-Carlo or finite-size-scaling sweep, write an axis as a **grid** instead of a
hand-typed list. It expands to a list *before* the product, so it sweeps exactly like one:

| form | expands to |
| --- | --- |
| `{ start = 1.0, stop = 4.0, length = 31 }` | 31-point linspace, inclusive → `Float64` |
| `{ start = 16, stop = 128, step = 16 }` | `16:16:128` → `Int` |
| `{ start = 1e-3, stop = 1.0, length = 7, scale = "log" }` | 7 log-spaced points |

`length` (≥ 2) and `step` are mutually exclusive; exactly one is required. A malformed grid
**errors** (it never silently degrades to a fixed value). A namespace that merely *contains* a
`start`/`stop` parameter alongside others (e.g. a `dt`) is **not** a grid.

### Fixed list values — `{ const = … }`

A plain list is **always** a swept axis. To pass a list as a *value* — an inhomogeneous coupling
vector, a field profile — wrap it in `const`; it is never swept:

```toml
J  = { const = [1.0, 0.5, 0.5] }   # one fixed 3-vector, carried in every DataKey
Js = [1.0, 0.5, 0.5]               # three separate runs (a sweep)
```

So the two leaf-table forms are duals: a **grid** (`{ start, stop, … }`) is a swept list, a
**const** (`{ const = … }`) is a fixed value.

## The one thing that trips people up

`DataKey.params` is keyed by the **dotted** `group.leaf` path, matching
`path_keys`:

```julia
param(key, "system.N")   # ✅  dotted
param(key, "N")          # ✅  the leaf, when only one group has it
param(key, "N", Float64) # ✅  …and refuses the conversion if it would change the number

key.params["system.N"]   # ✅  the raw Dict is still there
key.params["N"]          # ❌  KeyError — no resolution, and no report of what does exist
```

A fixed scalar (`J` above) is **not** swept but **is** carried in every `DataKey`
as `"model.J"`. Only `path_keys` participate in `format_path` (the directory
name); `canonical` uses *all* params plus the sample index.

## API

| Function | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `load(path; inherit=true) -> ConfigSpec` | parse TOML, merge `[base] inherit` |
| `expand(spec; sweep_order=nothing) -> Vector{DataKey}` | Cartesian product × samples |
| `expand_report(spec; sweep_order=nothing) -> NamedTuple` | the same keys, plus what deduplication removed |
| `project(spec, axes; total_samples=…) -> ConfigSpec` | the spec over `axes` alone |
| `project(key, axes; sample=key.sample) -> DataKey` | one key over `axes` alone |
| `artifact_key(spec, name, key) -> DataKey` | the point of artifact `name` that `key` needs |
| `artifact_identity(spec, name, key) -> String` | that point as a stable on-disk identity, with `version` |
| `artifact_keys(spec, name) -> Vector{DataKey}` | every distinct point of artifact `name` the sweep needs |
| `format_path(key, path_keys) -> String` | compact directory segment |
| `canonical(key) -> String` | stable, Julia-version-independent key identity |
| `param(key, name[, T]) -> value` | one parameter, resolved dotted-or-leaf and optionally typed |
| `resolve_path_keys(blocks) -> Vector{String}` | auto-detect `path_keys` if omitted |
